Nicole,"Highly recommend With Love & Hope! We received so many compliments on our ceremony with many people asking who it was that we used! Carol called us leading up to the ceremony to get to know us so she could craft our script. It was perfect! She made it feel exactly like ""us"". It wasn't just a generic wedding script which made it so special. It was engaging, romantic, funny and perfect. Kathy officiated on our day and she did an amazing job. People thought we had known her for years because of how personable she was! Can't recommend and thank them enough!"
Amy E.,"We loved working with Carol for our wedding. She was so thoughtful and caring, and it was important to her that our day was special to us. She was very responsive and professional. We highly recommend!"
Jenny S.,Carol did such a great job officiating our wedding. She took time to get know us and put together the perfect script for our ceremony. We're so grateful we found her!
Kristin,"Carol was such a lucky find for us! I remember during our first phone call that I had a list of questions written out to ask her. Before I had the chance to ask any, she had already answered them all! She wrote us the perfect ceremony that was 100% ""us"". We got a lot of compliments on our unique ceremony. I thought it was great that she checked in with us every month up until our wedding, just to see how things were going and if we had any questions. She's super responsive to messages and very professional. She was also the most affordable! If you need an officiant, Carol is the best!"
Tia T.,"Carol was nothing short of phenomenal. Such a wonderful lady who is such a bright and friendly person, she brought so much joy and ease to such a special occasion. It was simple and sweet just like what I wanted. Her pre-made vows added such a lovely touch and she made me feel so relaxed, like I'd known her forever. Would recommend her in a heartbeat to anyone wishing for an at-home wedding or even for those looking for a more formal officiant for their big day."
Shelby,"OMG, I cannot say enough good about Carol and Kathy. Kathy was very professional and thorough during our rehearsal and ceremony. She showed up on time and included all the elements we wanted in our ceremony. The script was amazing and heartfelt, and I love that we got to make it our own. Carol was our main point of contact throughout. She was always on time and made sure everything was how we wanted it. She was very responsive to all our inquiries. She was also our coordinator for the day of the wedding. I cannot say how thankful I am for all her help. I literally could not have done it without her. She was constantly checking in and making sure I was okay. She worked with all our vendors and made sure everything was perfect. When it was all over, even my mom commented on how amazing she was. I was very stressed getting ready, but she was like the calm in the storm that I really needed. Thank you so much Kathy and Carol! Our wedding was amazing because of you."
